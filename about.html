	<h1>ITZY HISTORY</h1>

	<p><strong>2015â€“2019: Pre-debut activities</strong><br><br>After failing to pass the auditions held by Fantagio, Chaeryeong was cast by the company through the K-pop Star 3 television series, along with her sister. In 2015, Chaeryeong participated in JYP Entertainment's survival show Sixteen, but did not make the final lineup of the winning girl group, Twice. The first member of Itzy to join JYP, Chaeryeong trained for five years. Ryujin was scouted at a Got7 concert and trained with JYP for four years prior to Itzy's debut. Both Yuna and Yeji joined JYP in 2015 and trained for three years, Yuna after being discovered by company staff and Yeji having successfully auditioned. The final member Lia initially auditioned for SM Entertainment and passed but was forced to back out at the last minute due to a disagreement with her parents. Several years later, Lia passed the JYP auditions and trained for two years.

	In 2017, Yuna and Ryujin appeared in BTS's "Love Yourself" Highlight Reel. The same year, the members (with the exception of Lia) appeared on the Mnet reality show Stray Kids as a project group alongside the boy group that would eventually be named Stray Kids.

	In 2017, Ryujin competed on JTBC's survival show Mix Nine. She placed first among the female contestants but lost to the male contestants overall.[8] Meanwhile, Yeji participated in SBS' The Fan but was eliminated in the fifth episode<br><br>

	<strong>2019: Debut with It'z Different and It'z Icy</strong><br><br>
	On January 21, JYP Entertainment announced that they would be debuting a new girl group, its first since Twice in 2015. The label's official YouTube channel uploaded a video trailer revealing the five members.

	On February 12, the group released their debut single album, It'z Different, led by the single "Dalla Dalla". The song incorporates elements from EDM sub-genres, such as future house and bass house. Its empowering lyrics were well received by audiences. The group scored one of the biggest Billboard debuts for a new K-pop act in years, with "Dalla Dalla" entering at number three and peaking at number two on the World Digital Song Sales chart. The shape-shifting confidence anthem sold 2,000 downloads in the United States in the week ending February 14, according to Nielsen Music, making it the best-selling K-pop song in the country that week. "Want It?," was released alongside "Dalla Dalla" and debuted at number eight and sold 1,000 downloads. "Dalla Dalla" also debuted as the second most popular song on YouTube.

	Billboard confirmed that the music video surpassed 17.1 million views within 24 hours of its release and broke the record for the most viewed K-pop debut music video within 24 hours. On February 21, eight days after their debut, Itzy received their first music show win on M Countdown, becoming the fastest girl group to achieve their first music show win. The song went on to win on music shows nine times and broke the record at the time for the fastest K-pop debut music video to reach 100 million views on YouTube.

	Itzy's first extended play, It'z Icy, was released on July 29, along with a music video for its lead single "Icy".Commercially, the EP was a success, peaking at number three on the Gaon Album Chart. "Icy" continued the group's success on music shows, earning 12 wins, including a triple crown on Show Champion. On September 22, JYP announced Itzy's showcase tour, the Itzy Premiere Showcase Tour "Itzy? Itzy!". The tour kicked off in Jakarta on November 2 and went on to different cities in Asia throughout the end of 2019 before heading to the US for five shows in January 2020.

	In November 2019, "Dalla Dalla" surpassed 100 million streams on Gaon Music Chart, earning the group their first platinum certification. It was the first debut song by a K-pop group to earn a platinum certification from the Korea Music Content Association since the introduction of certifications in April 2018. The single also ranked eighth on the list of "The 20 Best K-pop Songs of 2019" compiled by Dazed, which described the group as having kept "a steady hand on the rudder using the fun touches even with the visual and sonic chaos going on around" and "the ones to give K-pop a fresh boot up". The music videos for "Dalla Dalla" and "Icy" entered the list of South Korea's most popular music video on YouTube at numbers two and seven, respectively. At the end of the year, Itzy won several Best New Female Artist awards, including at the 2019 Melon Music Awards and the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards.<br><br>

	<strong>2020: US showcase tour and continued commercial success</strong><br><br>
	Itzy began the year with the US leg of their showcase tour. Their first show was on January 17 in Los Angeles.

	On March 9, Itzy released their second EP, It'z Me, and its lead single "Wannabe". Featuring work from producers such as Sophie and Oliver Heldens, the EP saw the group experiment with EDM sounds while maintaining lyrical themes of freedom, self-confidence, and individuality. It'z Me debuted at number one on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart, making it the group's first number one album in the country. It also debuted at number five on the Billboard World Albums chart, their highest position on the chart at the time. The group went on to achieve eight music show wins with "Wannabe".

	On August 17, Itzy released Not Shy, their third EP, as well as the music video for the lead single of the same name. Although it featured Itzy's signature "teen crush" pop sound, the album marked a lyrical shift as the group transitioned from singing about "themes of independence and self-love" to "tipping their toes into the waters of singing about love." The EP debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart with sales of over 219,048 units. It was their second release to top the chart. "Not Shy" was also promoted on music shows, achieving five wins.
